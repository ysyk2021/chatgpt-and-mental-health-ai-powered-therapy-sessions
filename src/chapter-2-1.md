### Emotional Well-being

Emotional well-being relates to an individual's ability to understand and manage their emotions effectively. It involves recognizing a wide range of feelings, expressing them appropriately, and adapting to challenges and stressors without being overwhelmed by negative emotions.

### Psychological Well-being

Psychological well-being encompasses cognitive and mental processes that influence a person's perception, thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes towards themselves and others. It includes a sense of purpose, self-acceptance, positive relationships, personal growth, and the ability to cope with life's challenges.

### Social Well-being

Social well-being refers to the quality of an individual's interactions and relationships with others. It involves building and maintaining supportive connections, fostering a sense of belonging, and having a reliable support system. Positive social interactions contribute to overall mental health and provide a sense of fulfillment and connectedness.

### Resilience

Resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity, trauma, or significant life stressors. It is an important aspect of mental health as it enables individuals to navigate challenges, adapt to change, and recover from setbacks while maintaining a sense of well-being and functionality.
